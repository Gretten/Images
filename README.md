# Imgrinder 0.8
This is a simple tool based on Gulp task runner.
What can it do:
- optimize all pngs, jpegs, whatever with one "gulp images" command;
- images size changing ("gulp resize");
- creating of sprites without any external services;
- clean HTML script, link and <a> tags from old src paths
- to be continued :)

# Install (you don't really want this, trust me):

1. Clone this little piece of chaos in some folder;
2. Type "npm install" in the command line;
3. Open gulpfile.js and change variables in its Control panel section;
4. Enjoy!
