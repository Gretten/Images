# Imgrinder 
This is a simple images changer based on Gulp task manager.
What can it do:
- optimisation: all files with one "gulp images" command;
- size changing ("gulp resize");
- creating of sprites without any external services ("gulp sprite").

# Install

1. Clone this little piece of chaos in your project folder;
2. Type "npm install" in the command line;
3. Open gulpfile.js and change variables in its command line section;
4. Enjoy!
