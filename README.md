# Imgrinder 0.7
This is a simple image handler based on Gulp task runner.
What can it do:
- optimize all pngs, jpegs, whatever with one "gulp images" command;
- size changing ("gulp resize");
- creating of sprites without any external services ("gulp sprite").

# Install

1. Clone this little piece of chaos in some folder;
2. Type "npm install" in the command line;
3. Open gulpfile.js and change variables in its Control panel section;
4. Enjoy!
